# html-jpg-parser
Simple function for parsing base64-encoded inline jpg images from html code and converting them to resized image files

## Description

```php
string htmlImagesToFilesAndResize ( string $html, number $max_width, number $max_height )
```

Returns parsed HTML string with all inline base64 jpg images converted to image files with <img> tags replaced by the ones that links to files.
For example:
```html
<img src="data:image/jpg;base64, [base64 string.....]" width="x" height="y">
<img src="data:image/jpg;base64, [base64 string.....]" width="xx" height="yy">
<img src="data:image/jpg;base64, [base64 string.....]" width="xxx" height="yyy">
[etc]
```
will be converted to
```html
<img src="dl/1.jpg" width="x" height="y">
<img src="dl/2.jpg" width="xx" height="yy">
<img src="dl/3.jpg" width="xxx" height="yyy">
[etc]
```
It also generates 100px x 100px thumbnail images to dl/thumbnails/[imgname].
This is very handy if you need to build a simple HTML editor with php and you don't want to mess with inline jpg images.
